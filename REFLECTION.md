## Deadline 1 - TUE 2020-12-01 (Dec 01)

1. Work that has been completed for this deadline included creating a Piece.java class that
   sets up certain attributes found in all chess pieces. Furthermore, each different chess
   piece (ex: King, Rook) has been created and extends the Piece class, in addition to having
   certain variables and methods of their own depending on the type of piece. A Square class was
   also created that represents an individual square of a chess board and its current state. This
   class will be used to help analyze events such as whether the King is in check.
2. For the next deadline, it is imperative that I complete all aspects of the Chess game and make
   my code fully playable, though I am not expecting to completely implement a GUI for the chess
   game yet. It should be possible to play the Chess game through other means, however, such as
   through the terminal as part of a testing phase before I move on to GUI implementation.
3. I anticipate that I will have a lot of branches regarding developing each individual Chess
   Piece. As it is likely that I will encounter bugs not previously addressed or may have forgotten
   a component in one of the chess piece classes, this will likely mean that I will branch a lot in
   this aspect in order to return to previous code to revise them.
